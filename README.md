# Book Search Engine

## Description
  
In order to find books using key words, I have created a book search engine connected to mongodb using graphql. Creating this application was necessary to practice my react skills and get try to understand the shift towards using graphql. I learned how to connect an apollo server to my epress server and use the graphql api to make queries and mutations that affect our mongodb.
